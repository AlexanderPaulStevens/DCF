# DCF

I've worked to create this as part of an effort to learn valuation methodologies. This repository allows for rapid current and historical DCF workups which can be compared to a number of values. 

I have found tweaking each of the configurable variables to help with developing an insight into how the assumptions made when doing discounted cash flows play a role on the end valuation. This insight is essential to utilizing DCF effectively.
