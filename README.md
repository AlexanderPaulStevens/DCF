# DCF: Discounted Cash Flows

I've worked to create this as part of an effort to learn valuation methodologies. This repository allows for rapid current and historical DCF workups. 

I have found tweaking each of the configurable variables (CapEx growth, Revenue growth, etc) to help with developing an insight into how the assumptions made when doing discounted cash flows play a role on the end valuation. This insight is essential to utilizing DCF effectively.

### Dependencies

```pip install matplotlib urllib seaborn```

### Examining the impact of changing the discount rate on Net Present Value
